# Diabetes_Prediction

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain
diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. The content of the datasets consists of several medical predictor 
variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had,
their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

1.	Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.
2.	Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
3.	BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
4.	SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
5.	Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
6.	BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
7.	DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function.
8.	Age (years).
9.	Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1).


The aim was to build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset
have diabetes or not? Hereafter explanatory data analysis and dealing with outliers and data preparation, 
LogisticRegression, SVM, and Tree models were used for predictions. LogisticRegression revealed the best 
performance and was used as the final model.
